#writing the path to the location in which you would like to save the dataset

#execute training script
python model_centric_track.py

#the first execution will require hours, since it has to download the entire dataset (239.25 GiB)
#it will train a sample architecture on the dataset to get you started
#then you can modify the script as you like, and propose your own model architecture!
